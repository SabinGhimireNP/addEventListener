# 📌 Topic: addEventListener

Today's project was more of a **lesson** rather than a hands-on project. We explored one of the most commonly used features in JavaScript: **`addEventListener`**.

In this lesson, I learned about **event bubbling** and how it works 🔄. I also explored the following concepts:

- ➡️ **Capture:** Executes the event from the top level downwards.
- ➡️ **Once:** Ensures the `addEventListener` runs **only once**, then blocks any further execution 🚫.
- ➡️ **`event.stopPropagation()`:** Used inside an event listener to **stop the bubbling effect** of the event ⛔.
